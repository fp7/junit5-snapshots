TODO
- Comparing strings with backticks and empty lines in it
- Serializing arbitrary objects to a comparable string format
  - most likely pretty printed json
  - Make serializer impl pluggable
  - Use same serializer for snapshots? There is actually no reason to use the jest snapshot format
- Write quick start

# 2. Snapshot format

Date: 2019-05-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I need a format to store the snapshots generated by the snapshot tests.
The almost only requirement is that it should be human readable. 
I could use jest's format or pretty printed json.

## Decision

I just use the same format as jest does. 

## Consequences

The jest format is written for javascript execution. But I implemented it right away without looking
at first how jest does things. So now it is there and I will just stick with it.
